## Semantic HTML
> Semantic tags in HTML are used to provide information about meaning of the web page to the browser rather than just presentaion. For example, the tags \<div\> and \<span\> are non semantic tags. They only define structure of the web page. But tags like <table> and <article> clearly defines its content.
### Why should we use it?
> Semantic tags make the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also improves automated processing of documents.
### Accessibility from day one!
